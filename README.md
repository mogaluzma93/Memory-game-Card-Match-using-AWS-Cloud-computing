This project focuses on automating the deployment of games through the establishment of a 
continuous integration and deployment pipeline, seamlessly connecting GitHub repositories 
with AWS S3 hosting.Beginning with the game development phase, meticulous attention is 
given to structuring files in a manner conducive to web deployment, with version control 
managed through a dedicated GitHub repository. AWS infrastructure is meticulously configured 
to harness the power of S3 buckets, strategically organized to host game content while ensuring 
broad accessibility to users. Leveraging a suite of AWS services including CodePipeline, 
CodeBuild, and potentially CodeDeploy, the pipeline orchestrates deployment workflows with 
precision and efficiency. Crucially, testing and validation mechanisms are seamlessly integrated 
into the pipeline, ensuring that every deployed game update meets stringent quality and 
functionality standards. Real-time monitoring and logging capabilities provided by AWS 
CloudWatch offer invaluable insights into pipeline execution, empowering developers to swiftly 
identify and address any issues that may arise. Through this comprehensive integration, 
developers are empowered to iterate rapidly and deliver immersive gaming experiences that 
captivate and delight users, marking a significant leap forward in the realm of game development 
and deployment.

RESOURCE LIST:
 S3 bucket (Amazon Simple Storage Service)
 AWS CodePipeline
 GITHUB Version2


Procedure:
Initial Setup and AWS Amplify Configuration:
Step 1: Set Up AWS Account
Sign up for an AWS account if you don't have one already.
Navigate to the AWS Management Console.
Step 2: Create an S3 Bucket
Go to the S3 service.
Click on "Create Bucket".
Enter a unique bucket name and choose a region.
Configure additional settings as needed and create the bucket.
Step 3: Set Up GitHub Repository
Create a new GitHub repository or use an existing one for your game's source code.
Push your game code to the repository.
Step 4: Create AWS IAM Role
Go to the IAM service.
Click on "Roles" and then "Create role".
Choose "AWS service" as the trusted entity and select "CodePipeline".
Attach policies granting necessary permissions, such as AmazonS3FullAccess.
Review and create the role.
Step 5: Set Up AWS CodePipeline
Go to the CodePipeline service.
Click on "Create pipeline".
Enter a pipeline name and select "New service role" (created in Step 4).
Configure the source provider to GitHub and connect to your repository.
Configure the build stage (if required) and set it to "No Build".
5
For deployment provider, choose Amazon S3 and select the bucket created in Step 2.
Configure the deployment settings and IAM role.
Review and create the pipeline.
Step 6: Configure GitHub Webhook
In your GitHub repository settings, go to "Webhooks".
Add a new webhook and set the payload URL to the CodePipeline webhook URL.
Choose the events that trigger the webhook (e.g., push).
Step 7: Test the Pipeline
Make a change to your game code and push it to GitHub.
Monitor the CodePipeline dashboard to ensure the pipeline triggers and deploys the changes to S3.
Step 8: Monitor and Iterate
Monitor the pipeline for any failures or issues.
Iterate on the pipeline configuration as needed for optimization and improvements.
Consider adding additional stages for testing, security checks, etc.
Step 9: Document and Maintain
Document the pipeline configuration and any custom scripts or settings.
Ensure regular maintenance and updates to keep the pipeline running smoothly.
